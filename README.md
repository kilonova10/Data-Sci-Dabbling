# Data-Sci-Dabbling
General data science work


Including comprehensive notebooks and .py scripts with all things data science

1. Pulling climate data from weather stations and applying intelligence to determine trends
2. Using a library to produce a map of pre-defined coordinates and generate different projections to understand the characteristics of the chosen region

3. Training neural networks (RNN) and applying regression models to datasets in TensorFlow (LSTM for example)
4. Simple machine learning classifiers on spam data and sentiment data using the common Multinomal Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
5. Exploring applications of OpenCV on images (Gaussian Blur, binary thresholding, etc.)
6. Natural language processing on text through splitting sentences and producing lists of named entities present

More coming soon!
